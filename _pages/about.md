I'm Kuan-I Gary Chung (鍾冠毅, jhōng guàn yì). I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), advised by [Prof. Daniel Moyer](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/daniel-moyer). I am also a student affiliate at [Vanderbilt Istitute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/). I am interested in machine learing application in medical imaging.
