I'm Kuan-I Gary Chung (鍾冠毅, jhōng guàn yì). I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), advised by [Prof. Daniel Moyer](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/daniel-moyer). I am also a student affiliate at [Vanderbilt Istitute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/). I am interested in probabilistic model and machine learing application in medical imaging.

Prior to my PhD position, I was a senior engineer at [Wistron](https://www.wistron.com), working on ML application in industry and medical imaging. I was also a visitin researcher at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu), working with [Prof. John Guttag](http://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/), [Prof. Adrian Dalca](https://www.mit.edu/~adalca/), and [CAML Lab](https://caml.csail.mit.edu). Before my career at Wistron, I completed my BS(2016) and MS(2018) in Applied Mathematics at [National Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.nsysu.edu.tw), Taiwan, advised by [Prof. Mong-Na Lo Huang](https://math.nsysu.edu.tw/p/405-1183-1754,c8612.php?Lang=en).
